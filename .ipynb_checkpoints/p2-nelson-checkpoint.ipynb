    "### Research Question: What common speech patterns can be found in positive and negative commentary?\n",
    "Our group wanted to explore how people tend to speak when talking in an extremely positive and negative manner, especially in the context of movie reviews. Are there specific words that are frequently used when speaking in a positive sentiment versus a negative one? How often do those words show up in speech? How polarizing are these frequently used words? Do people tend to speak more when they are feeling positive or negative about something? This is the first step that we want to take when analyzing the speech patterns of movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it Matters\n",
    "With this information, we can later see whether these patterns match typical human behavior/speech, or if they are more specific in an online, more anonymous environment. We can use our findings to potentially see how polarizing these spaces are and how they affect our society in the long run as this type of analysis can also be used on things like social media comments and news articles where commentary can be even more polarizing. As we explore speech patterns in settings outside of normal, in person conversation, we can get a better idea of how people truly think and feel in certain environments or how people will think and feel given what we already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "[IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)\n",
    "[More Dataset Information](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews Large Movie Review Dataset from kaggle which contains 50K movie reviews. This dataset can be used for binary sentiment classification as it contains highly polar movie reviews for training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://gist.github.com/mkulakowski2/4289441\n",
    "\n",
    "https://gist.github.com/mkulakowski2/4289437\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to indentify the positive and negative words, we can easily scan the web for premade datasets. These two shown above are datasets containing negative and positive words, respectively, that we can use to analyze our movie reviews with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Scope\n",
    "The intended analysis is to see what are the common \"positive\" and \"negative\" words being used and how often they are used. The resulting visualizations for this would probably be something like a bar chart highlighting the ten most common \"positive\" and \"negative\" words and how often they appear in the dataset. We can also how long \"positive\" reviews are compared to \"negative\" reviews by checking the word count for each review and plotting the total word count frequency in a separate bar chart. Another analysis we could do is categorize common \"positive\" and \"negative\" words to see how polarizing they really are and plot this on another bar chart to visualize the scale of how positive \"positive\" reviews are and how negative \"negative\" reviews are.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Insights\n",
    "We expect to see more polarizing \"positive\" and \"negative\" reviews to be lengthier in word count as people tend to speak more than they are feeling extremely \"positive\" or \"negative\" which is typical in normal, everyday, real life behavior. However, many people tend to not show their true thoughts and feelings when speaking in public, so perhaps in spaces like movie reviews, people's wording may be more polarizing than if they were to be giving the review in person. In other words, their online, anonymous reviews may be a lot more emotional and biased than what people would typically say aloud. We might see that although online commentary may reflect human behavior in that it represents what people actually are thinking and feeling, it may not be representative of what people would normally say to others. However, organizations can use these findings to gauge a more truthful reaction from the public for their respective initiatives and campaigns to see what they need to improve upon in order to generate a positive response."
